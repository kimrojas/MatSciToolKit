# EXAMPLE: DIPOLE MOMENT CALCULATION

This is an example of how to use the ASE to calculate the dipole moment of a molecule. There are two steps for this process. 

1. Structure calculation (relaxation)
2. Dipole moment calculation

Step 1 is not necessary, if you already have a relaxed structure but since this example manually created the H2O structure, we will relax it first.

For reference, the precalculated files are given in `reference` folder.
